# Sinta Fergus's Computation Page

I am a 2nd-year student at [Macalester College] (http://www.macalester.edu) majoring in Neuroscience.

As a Neuroscience major, I am required to take a computer science course.  This is the front page for my Scientific Programming course, [COMP121] (http://dtkaplan.github.io/ScientificComputing/).

Attached below are links to some of the projects I have worked on throughout the duration of this course.
